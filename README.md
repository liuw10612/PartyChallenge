Project Overview

A local restaurant wants a reservation system they can access from a web browser. They want something that looks nice, is easy to use, and helps them manage day-to-day business.

Project Requirements

1.       A reservation must have the date, the time, the party's name, and the number of people in the party.

2.       The host must be able to add reservations.

3.       The host must be able to cancel reservations.

4.       The host must be able to mark a reservation as fulfilled.

5.       The application must be a Single Page Application (no server rendering). Angular is preferred but not strictly required.

6.       The application must have a simple workflow, and look visually appealing.

7.       The reservations should be stored in localStorage between page loads, so they can be retrieved if the browser tab is closed and re-opened.

8.       Bonus points for adding any enhancements or extra features above and beyond what is described above.
